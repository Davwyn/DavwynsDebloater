# DavwynsDebloater
A project to debloat Windows 10 and 11 as well as remove telemetry/spyware and other bloat that makes Windows slow and annoying.

The script entirely uses Group Policies, Registry Settings, and built-in Windows functions to debloat systems. It does not break Windows update for Windows functionality.

The script also does not rely on 'hacky' tricks with the one exception of it's method to remove Microsoft Edge from the system.

This script is utitlized by [MurrpTools](https://github.com/Davwyn/MurrpTools-WinKit)
